# Homework1-Code-Refractor
Homework 1
In this homework, we needed to meet accessibility standards. For the first step, I added semantic HTMl elements to the index.html. I added header, main, nav, aside, sections and a footer tag to the code. In the head tag the website name Horiseon was changed. And in the header tag under h1, the nav tag was added. I chose to use main under the header tag. And within main I used section tags. I also assigned an aside tag with sections. For the footer tag I update h3 to h4. 

Next, I changed a few things in CSS to matchup with the html code. And put it in order.

The image elements didn't have any alt attributes. For each image tag I assigned an alt attribute.
